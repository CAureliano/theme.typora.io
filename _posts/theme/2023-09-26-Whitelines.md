> It's easy; dark lines distract, white lines don't.

To anyone who has used [Whitelines](https://www.whitelinespaper.com/) notepads, this theme should be familiar! This theme, based on the notebooks, uses a light grey background with white lines, so that your text stands out. Included with Whitelines is its companion theme, Blacklines, which is the same concept in reverse: Black lines on a dark grey background.

Whitelines v2 is the second incarnation of the Whitelines theme, you can download older versions [here](https://github.com/TEParsons/Whitelines/releases).
